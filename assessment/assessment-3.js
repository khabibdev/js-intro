// Challenge-1
// Remove spaces
// Create a variable that contains the sentence "I Love JavaScript" with each word starting with an uppercase letter and no punctuation. Remove the spaces between the words, reassign this new string to the same variable, and print the new value.

// Challenge-2
// Correct javascript
// Given a variable named javascript that holds the string "javascript", transform this string into "JavaScript" using string methods. Then, reassign the transformed string to the same variable and print the new value.

// Challenge-3
// Extract and Capitalize Initials from a Full Name
// Create a variable fullName that holds a first name and a last name (two words only), for example, "John Doe". Create a new variable called initial that is assigned the initials of the fullName, making sure the initials are uppercase.

// If fullName is "John Doe", then initial should be "JD".

// Challenge-4
// Remove the First Letter of Your Name from the Alphabet String
// Create a variable called alphabet and assign it the string containing all lowercase alphabet letters from "a" to "z".

// Create a variable named alphabetWithoutMyNameFirstCharacter. Assign to this variable the alphabet string with the first letter of your name removed, ensuring the operation is case-insensitive. This means that whether your name starts with a lowercase or uppercase letter, it should still be removed from the alphabet string. Print the result.

// Example
// If your name is "Alice", your task is to remove "a" from the alphabet string.

// Therefore, if alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", then alphabetWithoutMyNameFirstCharacter should be "bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" after the removal of "a".

// Challenge-5
// Remove the First Occurrence of a Selected Character from a Sentence
// Declare a variable named completeSentence and assign it the sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This classic sentence contains every letter of the alphabet, providing a full set to work with.

// Define a variable randomChar and assign it a character from your completeSentence. For example, let's choose "o"

// Without using the replace method, declare a new variable missingRandomCharString. This variable will hold the completeSentence minus the first occurrence of randomChar. To accomplish this, you may need to split the sentence into parts or use a combination of substring operations, ensuring you only remove the first instance of randomChar.

// The aim is to extract and exclude the initial appearance of randomChar from completeSentence, forming a new string that lacks this specific character, and then assign this new string to missingRandomCharString.

// Example
// After removing the first occurrence of "o", the new sentence should be: "The quick brwn fox jumps over the lazy dog."

// Challenge-6
// Write a program to calculate the number of times a specific character appears in a given string.
// Declare a variable, randomString, assigning it a string value of your choice.

// Define a variable, randomChar, setting it to a character you wish to count within randomString.

// Calculate the number of times randomChar appears in randomString. Use the string length property, the replace method, or any other string methods you find appropriate to assist in your calculation.

// Output the count of randomChar within randomString using console.log.
